A little over a year ago I decided to take a leap of faith and dedicate all of
my time to learning a new profession.  Usually I avoid being trendy,
but there was a lot of real estate in my mind being taken up by the idea
of becoming a data scientist.

I have always been interested in answering questions, because what I
really enjoy is learning how things work.  Open ended questions often
lead to a cascade of learning.
