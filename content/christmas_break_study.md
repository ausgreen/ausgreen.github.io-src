One of the benefits of curiosity is that almost anything can seem interesting.
The downside is that this curiosity can lead to wasting time on unimportant things.

For my Christmas break I didn't want to waste my time.  I decided to make something
useful during all this excess free time.

###### What Topic Should I Research?

I want to apply what I learned during my first semester in the MS Analytics
program at GaTech.  I believe it is important to contribute to your community
so I believe I can add some value by analyzing birmingham alabama.

I posed a poll to my facebook friends with the question:
Which Research topic is more interesting?

These topics were kept broad on purpose.  Both are interesting
topics and certainly have value.  However the uncertainty of what information
is available kept the topics from becoming focused.  Since this is a
free time project with a brief deadline, the data collection process
has to be brief.

###### What types of information is available in prepared datasets/databases?


###### What type of data is available through scraping?
###### What types of questions can be answered with this data?

Hey Mayor Woodfin, I'm a Masters of Analytics student at GaTech living in the
birmingham area. I'm doing some broad independent analysis hoping to reinforce
the positive changes in economic/industry development in our city.
What programs or initiatives are worth researching?  What programs
would you like to implement in the future?
