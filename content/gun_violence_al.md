Some friends of mine were discussing the state of gun violence and crime in the United states
and thought that it would be worth trying to find out some more information.

All the information on the subject was generalized into statistics, and
detailed observations were separated across multiple sources and pages â€“
making browsing difficult and slow.

*Last Updated Nov 4, 2018: Changed title from 'State of Gun violence...' to
'State of Gun Crime, AL' because not all of the incidents on the map are gun violence incidents.
Many are instances of crimes that involved guns, but no human to human violence.
I believe that this is an important distinction.*
